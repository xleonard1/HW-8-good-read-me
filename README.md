# Read Me Generator
    
## Description
    
    The ReadMe Generator allows the user to  get time back by  automatically generating a readme based on the user's input. 
    
    - This was inspired by the need to create an easier and more efficient way of generating a readme file. Now, more focus can be spent on the actual code and debugging.
    - This project was built with the intention of helping the user. It was also a challenge to myself to understand node.js better.
    - It solves the problem of time being taking away from coders who should be coding and debugging
